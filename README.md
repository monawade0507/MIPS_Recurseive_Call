# MIPS_Recurseive_Call
Calculate the sum of the first LaTeX: n n  squares using nested function calls.


For full credit, you must implement nested function calls. You may reuse your function from part I in order to achieve this. Again, your main function should only be responsible for getting the user input and displaying the output to the console.

An example execution for this code is shown below:

Number of squares to sum: 4
Sum of the first n squares: 30
